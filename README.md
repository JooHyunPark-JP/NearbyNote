## App Overview

**NearbyNote** is a smart location-based memo app that automatically notifies you of your notes when you arrive at specific locations.  
It helps you remember important tasks based on where you are.

**Example Use Cases:**
- When you arrive at the office: "Prepare for today's meeting"
- When you get to the grocery store: "Buy fruits and eggs"
- When you get home: "Open the windows"

You can quickly create notes via **voice recognition** or **text input**,  
and easily save locations using the interactive map.
