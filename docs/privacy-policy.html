  <p><span class="mono">NearbyNote</span> (“the App”) provides location-based reminders on Android. We design the App to minimize data leaving your device. We do not operate any server backend.</p>

  <section id="data-we-access-process">
    <h2>1) Data We Access/Process</h2>

    <h3>Location (precise/approximate, including background)</h3>
    <p>Used to create and trigger your geofences and to display your position on the map.</p>

    <h3>Network &amp; map requests</h3>
    <p>Required to load map tiles and perform place search via Mapbox. Requests can include your IP address and app/device metadata needed to provide these services.</p>

    <h3>Microphone (optional, when you start voice input)</h3>
    <p>The App invokes the device’s built-in speech recognition service (e.g., Google Speech Services). Audio is handled by that provider according to your device settings. The App does not capture or store audio.</p>

    <h3>Local app data (notes, saved places, geofence settings)</h3>
    <p>Stored only on your device using local storage.</p>

    <p><em>The App does not include ads or third-party analytics SDKs.</em></p>
  </section>

  <section id="how-we-use-data">
    <h2>2) How We Use the Data</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Provide core features: geofence notifications, maps, place search, and optional voice input.</li>
      <li>Ensure reliability in the background and after reboot using Android Location &amp; Geofencing APIs (Google Play services), a foreground service, and a boot receiver.</li>
      <li>We do not use your data for advertising, profiling, or sale.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section id="third-parties">
    <h2>3) Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>To deliver specific features, the App interacts with:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Mapbox</strong> — map tiles and geocoding/place search. The Mapbox SDK and related services may process diagnostic or usage information in accordance with Mapbox’s privacy notice.</li>
      <li><strong>Device speech recognition service</strong> (e.g., Google Speech Services) — used only when you start voice input; processing may occur on-device or by the provider per device capabilities and settings.</li>
      <li><strong>Android/Google Play services (Location &amp; Geofencing APIs)</strong> — system components on your device that determine location and deliver geofence enter/exit events to the App.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do not receive your notes or transcripts on any server we operate.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="data-sharing">
    <h2>4) Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>We do not share data with third parties for their independent marketing. Limited transfers occur only as necessary to deliver maps/geocoding and, if invoked, speech recognition. Platform services (Android/Google Play services) may process location to provide system features.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="retention-deletion">
    <h2>5) Data Retention &amp; Deletion</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>On-device data (notes, geofences, saved places) remains on your device until you delete it or uninstall the App.</li>
      <li>Third-party processing (Mapbox, device speech service, platform location services) follows each provider’s retention practices.</li>
      <li>You can delete items in the App or uninstall to remove local data.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section id="choices-controls">
    <h2>6) Your Choices &amp; Controls</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Permissions</strong> — You can grant/deny location, microphone, and notifications at runtime and later change them in Android Settings.</li>
      <li><strong>Background location</strong> — Requested only to deliver geofence reminders; if you remove all location-based notes, background location is no longer needed.</li>
      <li><strong>Maps &amp; network</strong> — Maps and place search require network connectivity; disabling permissions or network may limit features.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section id="children">
    <h2>7) Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>The App targets a general audience and is not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect data from children.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="security">
    <h2>8) Security</h2>
    <p>All network communication uses HTTPS. Android cloud backup for the App is disabled to reduce unintended copies of local data. We do not operate a remote server for your notes.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="international-processing">
    <h2>9) International Processing</h2>
    <p>Our providers (e.g., Mapbox, device/OS services) may process data on servers outside your country. Refer to each provider’s privacy notice for details.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="changes">
    <h2>10) Changes</h2>
    <p>We may update this Policy; the “Last Updated” date will reflect the latest version.</p>
