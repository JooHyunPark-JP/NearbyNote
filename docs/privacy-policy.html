  <h1>Privacy Policy for NearbyNote</h1>
  <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> August 12, 2025</p>

  <p>This Privacy Policy explains how the NearbyNote mobile application handles user data. NearbyNote respects your privacy and was designed to prioritize simplicity, transparency, and on-device data handling.</p>

  <hr>

  <h2>1. What the App Collects — and Why</h2>
  <p>NearbyNote uses the following types of data strictly to support its core functionality:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Location Information:</strong> The app uses the user's location to trigger notes when the user enters predefined areas. Location data is processed locally and is never transmitted or stored externally.</li>
    <li><strong>Microphone Access (Speech Input):</strong> When users choose to create a note using their voice, the app utilizes Google’s Speech API to convert speech to text. Audio is not recorded or stored; the conversion is handled temporarily by Google's API.</li>
    <li><strong>Boot State & Wake Locks:</strong> To ensure that location-based reminders remain functional after device restarts, the app may start a minimal background service. Temporary wake locks may be used to maintain reliability during these operations.</li>
    <li><strong>Internet & Network Access:</strong> Network access is required to load map data (via Mapbox) and perform speech-to-text conversion. No analytics, tracking, or cloud-based storage is implemented.</li>
    <li><strong>Permission Management:</strong> A dedicated page within the app displays all requested permissions. Users can review their permission status and are provided with shortcuts to system settings to modify or revoke them at any time.</li>
  </ul>

  <hr>

  <h2>2. How the App Uses Data</h2>
  <p>Data collected is used solely for:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Displaying location-based notifications</li>
    <li>Enabling voice input for note creation</li>
    <li>Ensuring reliability across reboots and background states</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The app does not use any data for behavioral tracking, advertising, or analytics.</p>

  <hr>

  <h2>3. Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>NearbyNote does not share, sell, or transmit user data to any third party. All data remains stored on the user’s device and is never uploaded to a server.</p>

  <hr>

  <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
  <p>Because NearbyNote operates entirely on-device and does not connect to external servers, the risk of data breaches is significantly reduced. All permissions are requested transparently and used only when required to support key features.</p>

  <hr>

  <h2>5. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>NearbyNote is designed for a general audience and is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. The app does not knowingly collect data from children and does not serve personalized content or advertisements.</p>

  <hr>

  <h2>6. User Control</h2>
  <p>Users maintain full control over their data and permissions:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Permissions can be denied or revoked at any time</li>
    <li>Uninstalling the app permanently deletes all stored data</li>
    <li>In-app tools are provided to manage privacy and permission settings</li>
  </ul>
  <p>NearbyNote stores all data locally, ensuring user information remains private.</p>
